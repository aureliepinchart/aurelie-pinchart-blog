| Published in                  | Cancer Research, 19 August 2019                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Procedure / what was examined | MEK kinase = possible target for treatment  : drug screens + cell line + animal model experiments => MEK inhibitor trametinib combinated to cytokines TNFα and IFNγ => more cell death than MEK inhibitor alone                                                                    |
| Conclusion / discovery        | MEK inhibitors increase the number of receptors for TNFα +IFNγ improves the anti-tumor activity of MEK inhibitors and TNFα +MEK inhibitors increase expression of TNFα and IFNγ target genes + PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor with MEK inhibitors => strongest tumor regression  |
| Remaining questions           | further studies : combining MEK inhibitors and other immune therapies that increase expression of TNFα and IFNγ => find out if  modulation of the immune microenvironment along with tumor signaling is a good strategy to cure lung cancer patients with KRAS mutations           |
